			<p>Snapo joined Entropy in 2012 – just a year ago. Since then he has been almost too active and enthusiast to make things happen. When it comes to music Snapo has been a keen drum’n’bass lover for over ten years but has actively spinned decks for only two years. He has always been a fan of dark neuro and techstep as long as they have an organic vibe with a lot of drumming going on. Outside Entropy he also belongs to Outrageous Crew (ORC) with whom he makes a mark on the drum’n’bass scene of Finland.</p>
			<p>As a fan of dark and creepy soundscapes, industrial techno has found its way into Snapo’s mind which has led him to a neverending complex world of music production. Or as he would call it: “just learning the basics.”</p>
			<p>In the upcoming event Snapo will put his back against with another D&B enthusiast’s back Solari!</p>
