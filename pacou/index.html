			<p>Pacou was born and raised in Berlin where he still lives and works at present. Back in 1989 the sounds of House and Techno music took off there. He became a music collector and went to many now legendary parties and club events, which greatly influenced his future career. In september 1996 he released his first record under the name "agent cooper" (on the label "Raw Music") and shortly after his first single on Tresor as "Pacou". </p>
			<p>The following year 1997, Tresor released Pacou's first album "Symbolic Language", and he became a resident DJ at the club.</p>
			<p>The year 1998 marked a substantial progress in both DJ and production aspects of his career. He started playing around Europe, Japan and Australia, and changed over to fulltime work on music and performing as DJ. In 1998, Pacou founded his first own label "LL Records" to release some of his own material.</p>
			<p>A third LP "State of mind" was released in 2000, furthermore singles on the labels Djax, Konsequent, Music Man and others. Tour dates again ranged from Brasil to Australia. Tresor released another single "Last Man Standing" in February 2004 and a whole album "The Berlin Sessions" produced with Juan Atkins in 2005. </p>
			<p>His current project is the record label "Cache Records", started in 2005. So far Pacou have played in more than 30 countries, and the story will continue... spreading the good vibe. </p>
