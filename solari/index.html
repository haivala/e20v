		<p>When first hearing the golden notes of this transporting music called drum and bass, Solari's life was changed. Starting from the first bassline, he was hooked. </p>
		<p>And after years of running into every single DnB show there was in Helsinki and nearby towns, he found himself throwing parties since last autumn by being part of the Entropy crew. As a natural continuum for this (and being inspired by fellow Entropists, such as Snapo) trying to mix was the next logical step.</p>
		<p>Although he can be found wherever and whenever Amen Break is heard, Solari's keenest affection is drum and bass of the liquid variety, opposed to the more tech- and neuro-oriented sound of Snapo. On Friday you can watch these Entropy's dnb aficionados perform a back to back -set and see, how these dynamics play out on the floor.</p>
