		<p>Since 1996, when DJ Indigo was sent down to Earth to help mankind with hidden powers of music, he has been an influential character especially in finnish underground rave scene.</p>
		<p>As any ordinary extraterrestial DJ, he has his own unique supernatural powers:</p>
		<h4>1. Telepathy</h4>
		<p>Indigo can easily connect with the minds of the crowd and to choose always the right track at the right time.</p>
		<h4>2. Enhanced sense of rhythm</h4>
		<p>Indigo's ultra sharp beat matching skills make his sets easy to enjoy. Of course this also allows him to concentrate on other important things such as getting into the flow of playing.</p>
		<h4>3. Versatility</h4>
		<p>Indigo's complex alien mind allows him to master multiple genres of music. No matter what he chooses to play, it will always sound good.</p>
